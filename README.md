## VRINDHA STORE ANNUAL REPORT:


## REQUIREMENT:

- Compare the sales and orders using single chart.
- Which month got the highest sales and orders.
- Who purchased more men or women in 2022.
- What are all the different status in 2022.
- List Top 10 states contributing to the sales.
- Relation between Age and Gender based on number of sales.
- Which channel is contributing to maximum sale.


## Key Insights:

- The month with the highest number of orders was March, totaling 2,819, closely followed by February with 2,750. November saw the fewest orders, with just 2,083.
- Women contributed the largest share of sales, making up about 64% of the total, while men contributed only 36%.
- In 2022, 92% of the orders placed were delivered successfully, and only 3% of the products were returned.
- The leading sales channels were Amazon (35.48%), Myntra (23.36%), and Flipkart (21.59%), which together accounted for the majority of sales.
- Maharashtra (2.99M), Karnataka (2.65M), and Uttar Pradesh (2.10M) were the top three states in sales volume.
- Women aged 30 to 50 were the highest contributors to sales, representing 35.08% of the total, while teenage boys had the lowest contribution at just 1.38%.




## Suggestions:

- Since teenage males generated the least amount of sales, Vrinda Store could create targeted marketing campaigns or introduce new product lines specifically for this group to boost sales.
- With Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart being the top sales channels, Vrinda Store should focus on optimizing its presence on these platforms, such as by running promotions or offering exclusive products to drive more sales.
- Since women contribute the most to sales, improving the shopping experience for them, such as offering personalized recommendations, loyalty programs, or exclusive discounts, could further boost their purchasing activity.
- Given that Maharashtra, Karnataka, and UP are the top states in terms of sales, Vrinda Store could consider increasing its marketing efforts or opening additional outlets in these regions to capitalize on existing demand.
